# 🏨 MyTravaly Flutter Task

A **3-page Flutter application** developed as part of the MyTravaly Flutter Developer screening process.  
This project demonstrates frontend Google Sign-In UI implementation, API integration for hotel search, and pagination, all built using **Flutter**, **BLoC**, and **Clean Architecture** principles.

## 📱 App Overview

### **Page 1 – Google Sign-In/Sign-Up**
- Simple and clean UI for Google Sign-In/Sign-Up.
- Frontend-only implementation (no backend or Firebase integration).
- Purpose: Demonstrates understanding of Google Authentication flow in Flutter.

### **Page 2 – Home Page (Hotel List)**
- Displays a list of sample hotels.
- Includes a **search bar** to filter hotels by name, city, state, or country.
- On search action, navigates to the Search Results page.

### **Page 3 – Search Results**
- Fetches hotel data from the provided MyTravaly public API.
- Implements **pagination** for efficient loading of results.
- Displays hotel data in a clean, responsive layout.

## 🔗 API Details

### **Base URL**
https://api.mytravaly.com/public/v1/

### **Authentication Flow**

Before accessing any API endpoint, the app must first **register the device** to obtain a `visitor_token`.  
This token is then required for authorization in subsequent requests.

🔍 Search API Notes
The search functionality is implemented using the MyTravaly public search API.
The API supports the following searchType filters:
hotelIdSearch
streetSearch
citySearch
stateSearch
countrySearch
searchByKeywords
⚠️ Currently, only countrySearch is returning valid results from the API,
so this implementation uses that parameter to ensure functional search results.

This project follows a **Clean Architecture + Feature-Based Structure**,  
ensuring scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
